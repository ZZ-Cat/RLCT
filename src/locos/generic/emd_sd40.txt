#This file defines what locomotive your RLC PT2 chip will simulate. It is recommended that you save one file for each locomotive you have!
#NOTE: YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY MAKE A NEW FOLDER BEFORE YOU CAN START SAVING E2S INTO IT!!!

#General:

LocomotiveType = "EMD SD40"
    
Horsepower = 3000 #Horsepower Rating; meaningless if there is no prime mover.
Weight = 368000 #Total Locomotive Weight in lb.
Adhesion = 0.25 #Factor of Adhesion.
Axles = 6 #Total Number of Axles.
Motors = 6 #Number of Traction Motors. Anything else is just absurd, really. Meaningless for Cabcars/Snails.
MotorType = 0 #0 for DC, 1 for AC.
MaxGenCurrent = 6000 #How much current the generator/alternator can put out (not the RATED value).
MaxLoad = 1500 #Peak amount of Load current used for starting (How high does the loadmeter go?).
MaxContLoad = 1050 #Maximum amount of Load current the traction motors can take before entering the Short Time zone. Does not impact AC traction motors.
BaseSpeed = 65 #The top speed that's considered "normal" for this locomotive.
TopSpeed = 65 #Top Speed, in Miles per Hour, that the locomotive is capable of reaching due to the gearing. If you don't know, put 65.

#Pick a Prime Mover Config File! You can find them in "ptgamma/engines/" !
#include "rlctitanium/ptgamma/engines/EMD_V16_645E3_FuelSaver"
#What Engine should you pick for your locomotive? Google it.

UnitType = 0
#0 - Locomotive
#1 - Slug (No Prime Mover, has Traction Motors
#2 - Snail (No Traction Motors, has Prime Mover
#3 - Cab Car/Control Cab (No Traction Motors or Prime Mover)

#Transition
#                       1st 2nd 3rd 4th
TransitionGroups = array(2,  1         ) #The number of motors in series for each transition notch. Note that this number must divide into the number of motors evenly!
TransitionShunts = array(1,  1      ) #The ratio of current going through the field windings for each transition notch, as a fraction of the total load current.
GeneratorTransition = 0 #If a locomotive has Generator Transition, set this to 1.
LoadRampSpeed = 2 #How fast the engine loads when increasing power. 2 is sluggish, 10 is quick.

#Dynamic Braking Capabilities:

DynamicsMode = 1
#0 - No Dynamic Brakes
#1 - Dynamic Brakes with Mechanically-Driven Traction Motor Blowers
#2 - Dynamic Brakes with Electrically-Driven Traction Motor Blowers
MaxDynLoad = 700 #Maximum (peak) Dynamic Braking load current - If current limited, should be the same as continuous rating.
MaxContDynLoad = 700 #Maximum Continuous Dynamic Braking load current.
BlendedBraking = 0 #Modern Passenger Thing, turns on dynamic brakes when air brake application is made.
DB_Throttle = 0 #Throttle percentage to run the engine at for mechanical blowers. Use 0 for automatic adjustment (mechanical), electrical, or N/A.

#Bonus Features:

TractionMode = 2 #Traction Control Type:
#0 - No Traction Control (Early)
#1 - Automatic Power Reduction (Mid)
#2 - Automatic Power Reduction and Sand (Late)
#3 - Electronic Traction Control (Modern)
DPM = 0 #Dual Prime Movers. Set to 1 if your locomotive has two engines (Like a DDA40X, E unit, or GE 45 Tonner).
HEP = 0 #Head-End Power. Set to 1 if your locomotive is equipped with integrated HEP (like an F40PH or P42DC).
HEP_Subtract = 0 #The Amount of Horsepower to subtract when in HEP mode. GE locomotives use 200, EMD locomotives usually use 700.
HEPTYPE = 0 #0 for 4-8 HEP (Traditional), 1 for 2-4 HEP (For Modern, High-Horsepower Passenger Units like the GE Genesis series).
StarterMode = 0
#0 - Manual Primer, Manual Start
#1 - Latched Primer, Manual Start
#2 - Fully Automatic Start
OverloadProtection = 0 #If 1, the locomotive will reduce power if thermal limits of the traction motors are exceeded.

#Misc:

ClaspBrakes = 0 #Set to 1 if you have trucks fitted with Double Clasp or Triple Clasp brake cylinders.
HeadlightRGB = vec(255,255,200) #What color do you want your MU Headlights to be, if used.
Compressor_CFM = 255.1 #Flow rate of the air compressor when operating at rated speed, in Standard Cubic Feet per Minute
MainResVolume = 35 #Main air reservoir volume in cubic feet.
ZTX = 0.2 #Zero Throttle Excitation. Affects how much of the engine's power you get at low throttle. You should only change this for locomotives with really, REALLY high power-to-weight ratios.

# Hello and welcome to TCL's Advanced Class Splight Controller! This type of    #
# rotary switch can be found in pretty much any mid- to late-era diesel that    #
# has tri-beam (white/red/green) class lights.                                  #
#                                                                               #
# This controller E2 is designed to work in tandem with the TCL Advanced        #
# Tri-Beam Class Splight system.                                                #
#                                                                               #
# Setup:                                                                        #
#   1)  Spawn and position this E2 somewhere accessible from your engineer's    #
#       seat. ** It must be visible from the seat to be used. **                #
#   2)  Spawn, position and parent your Class Splight E2s - see their code for  #
#       any special instructions.                                               #
#   3)  Wire all inputs on this E2 to their respective outputs on your Pod.     #
#   4)  Wire the SwitchPos output to your Class Splight E2s.                    #
#   5)  Cycle through the positions by either aiming at the E2 or holding down  #
#       the key you've set to unlock it, and roll your mouse wheel.             #
#   6)  Make sure you parent everything, and enjoy!                             #
#                                                                               #
#   Tip- Not sure where to place your class light switches? Older Canadian      #
#   locomotives usually have a small extension built onto the left of the       #
#   control stand, directly adjacent to the brake controls, where the light     #
#   controls can be found. More modern locomotives with desktop stands have     #
#   them positioned overhead airliner style, or on the front face of the        #
#   console underneath the Engine Run/Gen Field/Fuel Pump triple switches.      #
#                                                                               #

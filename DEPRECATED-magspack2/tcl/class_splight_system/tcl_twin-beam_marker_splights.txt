# Hello and welcome to the TCL Class Splight System!                            #
#                                                                               #
# This E2 simulates the twin-beam "class lights" found on Canadian rail         #
# equipment, such as coaches and cabooses.                                      #
#                                                                               #
# Setup Tips:                                                                   #
#   - These lights are usually found on both sides of the ends of a railcar.    #
#   - The two beams can be oriented either vertically (as found on VIA coaches) #
#     or horizontally (cabooses/vans and other equipment).                      #
#   - Both sides should be independently controllable. Your control panel       #
#     should consist of three toggled Wire Buttons - both On inputs to a main   #
#     power button, and the individual Switch inputs to their own buttons.      #
#                                                                               #
# Operation:                                                                    #
#   In normal operation, the red lights should be illuminated at the tail end,  #
#   as you'd expect. However, when a train is stopped at a station or clear of  #
#   the main in a siding, the side facing the main track is switched to green.  #
#   This shows any other movements approaching from the rear that your train    #
#   is indeed clear of the main track and therefore safe to pass.               #
#                                                                               #
# Happy railroading!                                                     TCL <3 #
#                                                                               #
